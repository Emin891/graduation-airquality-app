        "CO": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas. Inhalation at high levels reduces the blood‚Äôs ability to carry oxygen, potentially causing headaches and loss of consciousness.",

        "NOX": "NOx is a general term for nitrogen oxides (NO and NO‚ÇÇ). It contributes to the formation of ozone and fine particulates, thus deteriorating air quality.",
        "NO": "Nitric oxide (NO) is produced during high-temperature combustion processes. While not directly harmful, it can convert into NO‚ÇÇ, leading to indirect health risks.",
        "O3": "Ozone (O‚ÇÉ) is harmful at ground level. It irritates the respiratory system, causes eye burning and coughing, and poses a risk especially for individuals with asthma."

                 These stations measure pollutants such as PM10, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, NO‚ÇÇ, NOx, NO, and O‚ÇÉ on an hourly and daily basis and regularly provide data through environmental sensors.
                 While fixed stations conduct continuous measurements at specific locations, mobile stations offer the ability to perform temporary measurements in different areas. The data covers the years 2022‚Äì2025.

                The hourly weather data used during the model training process was obtained from the Visual Crossing Weather API and corresponds to the Atat√ºrk Airport meteorological station in Istanbul, covering the years 2022‚Äì2025.
                This dataset includes meteorological variables such as temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, dew point, wind direction and speed, pressure, cloud cover, visibility, and solar radiation.
                This long-term and consistent dataset from a fixed location was chosen to ensure stability and uniformity during model training.

                When a user requests a prediction in the application, real-time and forecasted weather data is retrieved via the Visual Crossing API based on the selected district.
                This data is calculated as a distance-weighted average of measurements from meteorological stations closest to the chosen location.
                In this way, more realistic and district-specific input values are provided, allowing the application to generate air quality predictions that are most relevant to the user‚Äôs actual location.
